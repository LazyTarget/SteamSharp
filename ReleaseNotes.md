# SteamSharp Release Notes

## IN DEVELOPMENT

This project is still in development and is not yet ready for consumption. The code in `main` is not guaranteed (and in fact is most likely not) stable for a production application.

### Feature Set

This section is being built out as work is completed.

* Easy and intuitive framework to send and receive REST calls to the Steam API
* Send and receive complex objects which are conveniently serialized in JSON
* Make calls to the Steam API using Steam specified semantics (no complex URI building)
